(ns whisper.main
  "Kotodama WASM entrypoint for the whisper clean-room STT/ASR actor (L5).

  Clean-room, API-compatible STT surface (OpenAI `audio/transcriptions` +
  `audio/translations` shape), data-driven over a Datomic-backed Kotoba schema.
  No proprietary code, model weights, or credentials — resource shapes only.

  Closes the one missing primitive in ADR-2606271930: `elevenlabs-compat` is
  TTS (speech out); `whisper-compat` is STT (speech in). Together they are the
  voice I/O of the `denwaban` actor, bound by the `koe-clj` session kernel.

  R0 scaffold: socket-free core. `transcribe` folds over the in-memory `*store*`;
  `stream-transcribe` is fixture-driven (partial Segments → final Transcription)
  so denwaban's barge-in can be tested without a socket. Live audio ingest is
  outward-gated (G7) and lands in a later R-cycle — `solve` raises at R0."
